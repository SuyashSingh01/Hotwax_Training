### Order Item Current Status Changed Date-Time

**Business Problem:**
Operations teams need to audit when an order item’s status (e.g., from “Pending” to “Shipped”) was last changed, for shipment tracking or dispute resolution.

**Fields to Retrieve:**
- `ORDER_ID`
- `ORDER_ITEM_SEQ_ID`
- `CURRENT_STATUS_ID`
- `STATUS_CHANGE_DATETIME`
- `CHANGED_BY`

```sql
SELECT  
    order_id,  
    order_item_seq_id,  
    status_id AS current_status_id,  
    status_datetime AS status_change_datetime,  
    status_user_login AS changed_by  
FROM order_status  
ORDER BY status_change_datetime DESC;  
```
