### Items Where QOH and ATP Differ

**Business Problem:**
Sometimes the Quantity on Hand (QOH) doesn’t match the Available to Promise (ATP) due to pending orders, reservations, or data discrepancies. This needs review for accurate fulfillment planning.

**Fields to Retrieve:**
- `PRODUCT_ID`
- `FACILITY_ID`
- `QOH` (Quantity on Hand)
- `ATP` (Available to Promise)
- `DIFFERENCE` (QOH - ATP)

```sql
SELECT  
    product_id,  
    facility_id,  
    quantity_on_hand_total AS qoh,  
    available_to_promise_total AS atp,  
    (quantity_on_hand_total - available_to_promise_total) AS difference  
FROM inventory_item  
WHERE quantity_on_hand_total != available_to_promise_total  
ORDER BY difference DESC;  
```
