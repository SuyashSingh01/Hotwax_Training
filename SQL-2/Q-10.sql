### Total Orders by Sales Channel

**Business Problem:**
Marketing and sales teams want to see how many orders come from each channel (e.g., web, mobile app, in-store POS, marketplace) to allocate resources effectively.

**Fields to Retrieve:**
- `SALES_CHANNEL`
- `TOTAL_ORDERS`
- `TOTAL_REVENUE`
- `REPORTING_PERIOD`

```sql
SELECT  
    sales_channel_enum_id AS sales_channel,  
    COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders,  
    SUM(grand_total) AS total_revenue,  
    CONCAT(MIN(order_date), ' to ', MAX(order_date)) AS reporting_period  
FROM order_header  
GROUP BY sales_channel_enum_id  
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;  
```
